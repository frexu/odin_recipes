        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Every Thanksgiving my mother takes what's left of the turkey carcass and makes a delicious turkey soup that we enjoy for days. The first step is to make the stock, which you can get started on right after dinner.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Carcass from cooked 10- to 12-lb turkey</li>
            <li>3 quarts (12 cups) water</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon pepper</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon poultry seasoning or dried sage leaves</li>
            <li>1 dried bay leaf</li>
            <li>1/2 cup uncooked pearl barley</li>
            <li>3 medium carrots, sliced (1 1/2 cups)</li>
            <li>1 cup chopped onions</li>
            <li>2 medium stalks celery, sliced (1 cup)</li>
            <li>3 cups cut-up cooked turkey</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley leaves, if desired</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Break up turkey carcass to fit 6-quart Dutch oven. Add water, salt, pepper, poultry seasoning and bay leaf. Heat to boiling over high heat; reduce heat to low. Cover; simmer 1 hour 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Skim off any residue that rises to the surface. Remove bones, meat and bay leaf from broth; cool. When cool enough to handle, remove meat from bones, and cut into bite-size pieces; reserve. Discard bones and bay leaf.</li>
            <li>Skim fat from broth; discard. Stir in barley. Heat to boiling; reduce heat to low. Cover; simmer 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
            <li>Stir in carrots, onions, celery, 3 cups cooked turkey and reserved turkey cut from bones. Simmer uncovered 20 to 25 minutes, stirring occasionally, until vegetables and barley are tender. Stir in parsley.</li>
        </ol>
